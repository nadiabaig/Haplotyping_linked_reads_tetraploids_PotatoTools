## Constructing haplotype blocks for tetraploids using 10x-reads -- PotatoTools
### For QGGP's RIBS meeting only

This repository provides the bash script , I used for my 10x datasets to get the haplotype blocks for tetraploid genotypes using Hap++ pipeline in combination with H-PoPG (see the reference for github profile and paper).


Main steps of the pipeline inludes:
* Splitting the vcf file (multi-sample VCF) into per sample per chromosome VCF as the Hap10 pipeline works for 1 chromosome at a time
* Filtering the VCF by removing homozygous and non-SNP variants in tetraploids
* Runnng the Hap10 to get the haplotype relevant information
* Haplotype assembly using H-PoPG: For Haplotype assembly Hap10 pipeline uses SDhap tool but,it is not easy to install. 
  - It may takes few days! (&#x1F534;) 
```diff
+ It needs dependency ATLAS (Automatically Tuned Linear Algebra Software) libraries and also need lapack. 
- TO INSTALL it on our institutes server it needs disabling CPU throttling. From our institute 'Intel MKL' is available, but you need to bulid it by yourself  using module load  "intel/xe2020.4". (Not tried this alterantive-- In case anyone is interested try your luck)..
```
